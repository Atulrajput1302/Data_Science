## What is Data-Science
Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data.

Data Science involves using automated methods to analyze massive amounts of data and to extract knowledge from them.

Concepts to know:
 #### 1 . STATISTICS

  Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation and organization of data.
    
#### 2 . VISUALIZATION

Visualization is when we display the results of Data Science analysis in a simpler way using diagrams, charts and graphs.

It improves decision making, sense of work, customer relationship and financial performance.

#### 3. MACHINE LEARNING

Machine Learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.
Closely related to computational statistics.
Used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to a prediction which in commercial use is known as predictive analytics.

#### 4. DEEP LEARNING

Deep learning is one of the only methods by which we can circumvent the challenges of feature extraction in machine learning. This is because deep learning models are capable of learning to focus on the right features by themselves, requiring little guidance from the programmer.

Therefore, we can say that Deep Learning is:
 1. A collection of statistical machine learning techniques
 2. Used to learn feature hierarchies
 3. Often based on artificial neural networks
